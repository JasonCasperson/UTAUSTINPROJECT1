Introduction here***




After downloading the data from the CDC our teams first steps were to understand what data was represented in the file.  We explored which drugs, states and years were used in the data set, then filtered our new data sets down to contain only the values we wanted. We removed blank values and reorganized our data so it was clearer to understand. Finally we made graphs depicting the key findings of the data set.

The final factor our group analyzed brought in another dataset from schoolfundingfairness.org and compared Federal and State Funding to drug overdoses. To look at this, we first cleaned the new dataset and created a statistic standardized based off the number of students in the district. Our predicotr was the Mean of (Federal Funding + State Funding/ # of students). We grouped this information by state and merged the dataset with the original Drug Overdose information to perform our analysis. Both graphs indicated a minor correlation and if anything this correlation showed positive indicating higher educational funding would predict drug overdoses. For this reason it is safe to say with a basic linear regression test that there is no correlation between these two variables. Correlation statisics showed as 0.07 and 0.09 respectively.
